# Faster-RCNN Model Notice

This is tensorflow Faster-RCNN implementation from scratch supporting to the batch processing.
All methods are tried to be created in the simplest way for easy understanding.
Most of the operations performed during the implementation were carried out as described in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497) and [tf-rpn](https://github.com/FurkanOM/tf-rpn) repository.

It's implemented and tested with **tensorflow 2.1**.

[VGG16](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications/VGG16) is the only backbone I currently use
